# Ultrasound-HC-SR04
## This project requires a Nexys A7-50T board as well as a HC-SR04, a breadboard and some cables

It includes VHDL code which is for a project in which LEDs light up depending on the distance of a HC-SR04 from an object.


###Theoretical description and explanation
The point was to make a device that will measure the distance as long as it's between 2cm and 400cm and program it and build it to make it work. The nexys board will be connected to the breadboard and a voltage converter converting 3.3 volts into 5 volts, which is the voltage required for the sensor.
